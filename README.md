# Mybb FRPG Scripts
A collection of scripts written for a text-based role-playing game on a mybb-powered forum. (The theme was Star Wars, by the way!)

## List of scripts

### Utils

* [Set body class](/utils/setBodyClass)
* [Popup](/utils/popup)
* [Add button to form](/utils/addButtonToForm)

## Why?
I used to admin a role-playing forum. It was created on a free mybb-powered platform. The platform severely limited access to the code base (for obvious reasons), so one couldn't change almost any of the HTML. However, it was possible to change CSS and add your own scripts.

A roleplaying forum has a wide variety of needs that weren't covered by the basic functionality. So I wrote scripts to remedy that.

Also don't be surprised that some of the scripts are doing weird things that would normally be fixed in HTML itself, or on the backend side of things. I didn't have access to either of those things. Moreover, some of the HTML was written at the dawn of times and/or in a very inconvenient way. So I fixed it in the only way that was available to me at the time.

## Can I use them?
If for whatever reason you find any of them useful to youâ€”be my guest! Each script has a readme file explaining what it does and how to use it.
